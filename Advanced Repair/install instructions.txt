Install Instructions:
1. UnPBO your Mission File.
2. Open the Advanced Repair folder and copy the "custom" folder to the mission file you just unPBO'd (same folder as config.cpp file).
3. Add the below lines into the "initPlayerLocal.sqf" file from your mission file, immediately after "if (!hasInterface || isServer) exitWith {};".

//Advanced repair
Bones_fnc_salvageAndRepairMenuHelo = compileFinal preprocessFileLineNumbers "Custom\advancedRepair\Bones_fnc_salvageAndRepairMenuHelo.sqf";
Bones_fnc_salvageAndRepairMenuCar = compileFinal preprocessFileLineNumbers "Custom\advancedRepair\Bones_fnc_salvageAndRepairMenuCar.sqf";
 
4. Open the config.cpp file in your mission, find the "class CfgInteractionMenus" section, and replace the repair function for cars and helos respectively, with the following:

//Bones Custom Vehicle Repairs

class Repair: ExileAbstractAction
{
	title = "Repair/Salvage";
	condition = "true";
	action = "_this call Bones_fnc_salvageAndRepairMenuCar";
};


// Bones Custom Air Repairs
class Repair: ExileAbstractAction
{
	title = "Repair/Salvage";
	condition = "true";
	action = "_this call Bones_fnc_salvageAndRepairMenuHelo";
};

5. Re-PBO your mission file and re-upload to the server.
